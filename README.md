# Taxi-Tip-Prediction-using-Scikit-Learn-and-Snap-ML
Machine-Learning-Regression-Trees Taxi Tip Prediction using Scikit-Learn and Snap ML
n this exercise session you will consolidate your machine learning (ML) modeling skills by using a popular regression model: Decision Tree. You will use a real dataset to train such a model. The dataset includes information about taxi tip and was collected and provided to the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) by technology providers authorized under the Taxicab & Livery Passenger Enhancement Programs (TPEP/LPEP). You will use the trained model to predict the amount of tip paid.

In the current exercise session, you will practice not only the Scikit-Learn Python interface, but also the Python API offered by the Snap Machine Learning (Snap ML) library. Snap ML is a high-performance IBM library for ML modeling. It provides highly-efficient CPU/GPU implementations of linear models and tree-based models. Snap ML not only accelerates ML algorithms through system awareness, but it also offers novel ML algorithms with best-in-class accuracy.
